BIT MANIPULATION

This directory contains all the tasks in the ALX SE Bit Manipulation project.
Bit Manipulation is the process of algorithmically using bitwise operators to solve problems on the bit level. You do this because apparently it is faster to solve probelms on the bit level than on the normal level.

The following are the projects in this task

Task 0 - a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
Task 1 - a function that prints the binary representation of a number
Task 2 - a function that returns the value of a particular bit at an index
Task 3 - a function that sets the value of a particular bit at a particular index to 1
Task 4 - a function that sets a bit at a particular index to 0
Task 5 - a function that returns the number of bits you would have to flip to get from one number to another

The above 6 tasks are the mandatory tasks in this project
