VARIADIC FUNCTIONS

This directory contains the tasks for the ALX project on variadic functions

A variadic function is a function that has a variable number of arguments.
The number of arguments are not fixed or hardcoded; instead, users can insert an unlimited number of arguments at runtime.

* Task 0 - a function that returns the sum of all its parameters
* Task 1 - a function that prints numbers
* Task 2 - a function that prints strings
* Task 4 - a function that prints anything
